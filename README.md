CSE 3902 Project- Name TBD, developed by Destination Ohio

##INTRODUCTION The following repository contains the code for the CSE 3902 Project class by the group Destination Ohio. We are developing our own original game, but for Sprint 2, we have implemented many of the assets from The Legend of Zelda (Nintendo 1986).

##CODE STRUCTURE AND DESIGN PATTERNS 
Our code implements the command pattern for keyboard commands, the state pattern for the player animations and movement, state machines for the enemy actions and movement, a sprite factory for ease of animation, and the singleton pattern for several classes like the sprite factory, the object manager, and the level loader. The design patterns are the same as the previous sprints, but have been elaborated and improvised.

##DOCUMENTATION
To document our game design, art, and code design documents, the team operated with a shared Google Drive folder as well as a Trello. The team also used a Discord server for easy voice chat and means of contacting one another over text. 

##ART AND ASSETS
The team is creating our own art for this game. We are creating something with an original story with design elements that come from both Mario and Zelda. 
The following new art was added:
-updated player animations
-new item sprites
-"At dooms gate" music pack
-new backgrounds

New tile sets have been created, but have not yet been implemented in the game. We are going to add more music packs and sounds by the next sprint.

Assets that have yet to be created have been replaced by assets from The Legend of Zelda.

##THE FUTURE
While many bugs and design considerations have been fixed and taken into account for this sprint, there are still some issues that need to be ironed out. 
Smooth and efficient level loading is something we are still working on and will be implented next sprint. We will be working tirelessly to make the perfect game that every member of is envisioning.
