CSE 3902 Project- Name TBD, developed by Destination Ohio

##INTRODUCTION The following repository contains the code for the CSE 3902 Project class by the group Destination Ohio. We are developing our own original game, but for Sprint 2, we have implemented many of the assets from The Legend of Zelda (Nintendo 1986).

##CODE STRUCTURE AND DESIGN PATTERNS 
Our code implements the Command Pattern for object animation and keyboard commands, the State Pattern for the player animations, State Machines, and a Sprite Factory.

##DOCUMENTATION
To document our game design, art, and code design documents, the team operated with a shared Google Drive folder as well as a Trello. The team also opened a Discord server for easy voice chat and means of contacting one another over text. 

##ART AND ASSETS
The team is creating our own art for this game. We are creating something with an original story with design elements that come from both Mario and Zelda. 
For this sprint we implemented:
-Player idle animations
-Player running animations
-3 tiles for the second level

All of these items were created alongside background art, concept art, and a guitar swing (equivalent of a sword swing) animation that are not yet implemented in the game. 

##THE FUTURE
This code is not functioning fully at the moment. The team will be creating more assets, and working together to make sure the code can run smoothly between what is created across all branches. There are also many design-level details the team would like to improve such as consolodating all the different Manager files into one Manager.
