The planning for Sprint3 takes place on Google Drive and on Trello. The links to each are below.

Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12tBD0OoxzEWtA66OV9-D1PQgMvBOxmtd?usp=sharing

Trello: https://trello.com/b/3KLeSRbA/cse-3902-group-project

The Google Drive and Trello have been shared with our grader Chris Lenart (lenart.19).

***Written below is a copy of our planning document that is in the Google Drive for the project.***

Code Priorities and To-Do’s for Sprint 3:
Sprint 2 fixes
Reset-to-default function in game1
Update() and Draw() needs to be removed from each object interface and defined inside IUpdateable and IDrawable. The classes like “Player” or “BatEnemy” will then also implement IUpdateable and IDrawable in addition to any object interfaces. 
Object manager
Class for collision detection
Class for collision resolution
Level loading
Loading data from xml files
Update sprite sheets and tile maps as new sprites are made, and adjust the XML files
*need someone

Member Assignments (code stuffs):
***Due dates are mainly for when you should have drafts of those classes or functionalities ready to be reviewed.***
DO NOT START WORKING UNTIL THE SPRINT3 BRANCH HAS BEEN MADE AND THE MEMBER BRANCHES HAVE BEEN REMADE!!!
