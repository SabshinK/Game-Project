Sprint Reflection:

  Our team accomplished a lot this Sprint2, but we would’ve liked to get more working. Our team is creating our own game, so in addition to code, we are working to create assets like player animations, enemy animations, backgrounds, NPC sprites, blocks, items, and more. In addition to art, our group will also be creating music. 
  Our team implemented several design patterns like the command pattern, the state pattern, the state machine, and the sprite factory. These implementations are in progress, but they’ve come a long way over the course of the Sprint. 
  We distributed code across all team members. Team members were also creatively focused on art, music, game design, and writing. The creative assets will continue to be developed. For this sprint, we included the original character idle and run animations as well as 3 of the blocks that will be used. The backgrounds for each level have all been created and will be placed in the game for later Sprints.
  The team would definitely like to space the work out for the sprint more. This way, we would be able to debug and refactor code in an environment that is less stressful.
  Including the sprite factory helped our implementation greatly. 
  In the future, we would like to consider combining our asset managers into one Manager file. In general, consolidating classes may be a large point of focus for Sprint3. We already started creating necessary interfaces for collision, and will continue to develop them as we move forward. We also want to implement momentum into the player movement going forward. We need to develop a velocity variable that can be altered by multiple classes as well as an acceleration constant used to change the velocity.
