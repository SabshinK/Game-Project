Code Quality Comments: 
	The thing that jumps out at me right away is the player manager holding a "health" variable, which the player state already has. Overall, the code looks very simple and 
	the length is perfect, it's clear and concise, yet not lacking. I was worried about a potential middle man smell, but right now I don't see anything that would lead
	me to believe this class is acting as a middle man.

Hypothetical Fix:
	Separate Player more from the rest of the states, potentially create a decorator that inherits the current state of the player. Right now, I really only see the
	health variable being the problem, just because it's kept track of in more than one place.

Code Readability Comments:
	For the plethora of data here, this code is quite readable. The comments defining each section of what specific textures are being added where is incredibly helpful. Without
	these comments it would be very easy to get lost among the sea of very similar lines, yet each is split up and properly marked. The function names are also perfectly descriptive,
	which is great for the amount of data we're working with. My favorite readability piece in this code is the comment above the "CreateSprite" function that describes how to use it,
	and I referred to it many times when creating my enemy sprites. For having all of these sprites in one place, this class is incredibly readable.

Code Quality Comments:
	Line 26, the last line in the constructor, seems to be dead code commented out. Other than that, the constructor seems to have very simple usage and allows for the XML file to be in almost any directory, not specific to Sebastian's drive.
	The ParseAsset() function also makes intuitive sense. It took me a second to really get a grip of what was going on, so comments might be useful, however it seems to essentially take in a subtree of an asset, and create a list of strings
	based on the name and location of that object. This list is then added to a list of lists that hold the data to be passed to the LevelLoader from the Game1 class. I'm guessing the code Sebastian commented out has to do with checking if 
	the end tag is present, which seems to already have been done by the .Read() method of the XML reader, hence the comment out. My initial thought with the ParseItem method was too similar to the ParseAsset() function, but upon further 
	inspection I see that they have different uses, and their return types need to be very distinct. They both need to be formatted as they are, because other classes are going to use their return values and are expecting a specific output.
	The ReadToElement function should also be very useful when constructing specific items/tiles/etc. and is perfectly straightforward. Other than the dead code, I don't see any issues, and the hypothetical removal of said dead code is absurdly
	easy, just removing comments. We just have to be sure as a group that the XML files are all formatted as the parser is expecting.

Code Readability Comments:
	The thing I notice immediately is the lack of full uppercase names for the constant variables. I also see magic numbers, yet the comments associated with the lines explain them. Other than that, the variable names are incredibly
	straightforward and make reading the vast amount of physics formulas rather intuitive. More comments on the VerticalChange() method may also shed some light on what all the formulas practically mean.

Code Quality Comments: 
	This seems to be a pretty run-of-the-mill class that allows the player to select their items, drawing the currently selected item within the UI. My only criticism is the magic number within the draw command, which tells the
	game where to draw the object within the UI. Figured out by testing that this is where it is meant to go, but tripped me up a bit when I first saw it. Other than that, the other "magic numbers" on screen are only to grab the correct spot within 
	the list of items. On the other hand, I can't tell if this allows for a player to pick up an item and add it to the list, it looks like currently that is not the case. The scroller has all items right from the get go, and cannot help in the case
	of a player not having all items.

Code Readability Comments:
	This might be one of the most readable pieces of code I've ever seen. In terms of explaining the magic numbers that are being added, this class does it right. Even the conversion to an integer is explained within the comments, and it feels like I can
	follow it line for line with what it is doing. One thing that might be nice is an explanation at the top that explains what the utility class does. We have that info on our end, but readers of the code do not know Very short review, but it's also quite a short class.

Code Quality Comments: 
	Decently simple class that used to be part of a different one. The former issues with creating a god-class are now gone. This allows for a player to scroll right or left, and decide which item they want to be holding at the time. I do have a few critiques about this
	split however. Firstly, that the old class it was in, ItemScroller, is probably improperly named because this is the class doing the actual scrolling. On top of this, I do see a single magic number, 4, used for telling the player how much to heal by when using a specific
	item. It is explained in a comment, but a variable name might need to be introduced for it. Other than that, this does as it should - it handles items, and uses a switchcase quite effectively. This allows for efficient swapping of items without a lot of sorting or rearranging
	lists or queues to have one on top, it simply scrolls through an existing list of items.

Code Readability Comments:
	Overall, very readable code. At first glance, I noticed the weird naming scheme on the "uIManager", my recommendation is that this name be changed, as the strange camelCaps trip me up. Not the end of the world though! Other than that, the
	use of enums to keep the states actually makes this quite readable, with states like .playing and .paused, which are self-explanatory. It's also nice, because I know intuitively by names that the Draw method allows the needed UI to be drawn, and 
	the Update method allows the UI to be updated based on the game's current state. I've never understood a class with no comments better, and I don't even quite think they're needed in this case.
