The team made significant progress when completing Sprint 4, using the suggested deadlines to form a timeline for the tasks, debugging and planning. The team outlined the backlog and additional features as per the assignment's requirements such as the pause, item selection menu, and removing magic numbers. The code was also refactored to fix bugs in CollisionDetection, CollisionResolution and GameObjectManagers. One major change in the project was replacing the enemies list, projectile lists, item lists, etc in the GameObjectManager with GameObjects list which was a list of lists holding moveable and non moveable items. This simplified the collision and made it more efficient. The team also made progress on staying on task by creating checklists to check in the to-do list for the last week in the Google Drive Folder titled 'Last Week on Sprint 4 Planning.' This allowed the distribution of tasks which reached higher priority to team members. 
Although the planning document that the team constructed assigned individual members to specific tasks, the teamwork dynamic made these assignments flexible. There was a steady rotation of members asking for and offering help, and this constant collaboration ensured that each of the members was aware of what was happening across the project, not just in the individual class or method they were assigned to. 

The team also had a code review by the professor which helped the group recognize potential fixes and design improvements such as equality checks for doubles and repetition of code for the enemy classes. Thanks to the group's efforts, the task of debugging and attempting to fit everything together became less daunting than in the previous sprint. All of this being said, there is still room for improvement with planning and communication. Next sprint, the group will put a bigger emphasis on setting and following intermediary deadlines, as well as communicating with members before adding major changes to shared code.
