### Coding Things for Sprint 4:

#### **Sprint 3 fixes:**
When collisiondetector accesses gameobjectmanagerâ€™s lists, should have a function in gameobjectmanager that returns the list you want (instead of having the lists be public)


Member Assignments (code stuffs):
***Due dates are mainly for when you should have drafts of those classes or functionalities ready to be reviewed.**
DO NOT START WORKING UNTIL THE SPRINT4 BRANCH HAS BEEN MADE AND THE MEMBER BRANCHES HAVE BEEN REMADE!!!

Make a method for returning the needed list to the object manager rather than having all the lists be public.
Look over the logic for how collisions are detected and simplify it. (TA suggestion on graded Sprint3)
