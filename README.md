# Game-Project
CSE 3902 Project- Name TBD, developed by Destination Ohio

##INTRODUCTION The following repository contains the code for the CSE 3902 Project class by the group Destination Ohio. We are developing our own original game, but for Sprint 2, we have implemented many of the assets from The Legend of Zelda (Nintendo 1986).

##CONTROLS
A - move left
D - move right
Z - use sword
N - use sword
1 - bow and arrow
2 - bomb
3 - boomerang
4 - candle
5 - sword beam
Q - quit
R - reset

##CODE STRUCTURE AND DESIGN PATTERNS 
Our code implements the command pattern for collision resolution and keyboard commands, the state pattern for the player animations and movement, state machines for the enemy actions and movement, a sprite factory for ease of animation, and the singleton pattern for several classes like the sprite factory, the object manager, and the level loader.

##DOCUMENTATION
To document our game design, art, and code design documents, the team operated with a shared Google Drive folder as well as a Trello. The team also used a Discord server for easy voice chat and means of contacting one another over text. 

##ART AND ASSETS
The team is creating our own art for this game. We are creating something with an original story with design elements that come from both Mario and Zelda. 
While we have not created any new art or music for this particular sprint, some of the assets we have created include:
-Player idle animations
-Player running animations
-3 tiles for the second level

All of these items were created alongside background art, concept art, and a guitar swing (equivalent of a sword swing) animation that are not yet implemented in the game.

Assets that have yet to be created have been replaced by assets from The Legend of Zelda

##THE FUTURE
While many bugs and design considerations have been fixed and taken into account for this sprint, there are still some issues that need to be ironed out. There is a framework for creating levels smoothly and implementing different functionality for enemies and projectiles than Zelda or Mario, which we hope will be elaborated on in the sprints to come. We will continue to build on this framework and create more art and music so that the full vision for the project can come to fruition
