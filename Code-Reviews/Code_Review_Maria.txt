Comments On Code Quality:
Projectiles shouldn't need to be passed here.
The use of a timer to determine when the state is over will probably need to be changed for future sprints.
The Attack and UseItem methods are useless here (and in some other classes, maybe should refactor).
One thing that I found confusing my first time looking at the code was "FaceRight" and "faceRight" having near identical names.
Personally I would use different names for these.
Each method is concise. Comments could be more descriptive.
The code is readable, and the spacing, variable naming, and other syntactic decisions are consistent (with the exception of the brackets on 22-23).
I understand that projectile and this.projectile are different and there is nothing technically incorrect or problematic about this 
naming decision, but personally I find using the same name to be confusing.

Hypothetical Change(s) to to the Game that Are/Are Not Supported by This Code:
Transition to next state should happen when the animation is complete, but with the current implementation the length of time before the state
changesis not guaranteed to match the length of the animation.

Comments on Code Readability:
There is only one descriptive comment.
None of the variables are classified as private, public, etc.
It might be better to have one enemy class with sprite, health, etc. instead of having different classes for each enemy. This is more about 
maintainability than readability, but there's a lot of duplicated code.
All of the methods are concise with the exception of Update(), which looks messy and should be refactored. The brackets and spacing are inconsistent
and the function looks a little squished and difficult to read.
